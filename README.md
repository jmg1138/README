# README  

A "Manager README" for Joshua

In the spirit of [this](https://hackernoon.com/12-manager-readmes-from-silicon-valleys-top-tech-companies-26588a660afe?gi=c9fee3efea74), and [this](https://soapboxhq.com/blog/management-skills/49-manager-readmes), here's a "Manager README" that has some stuff in it that might provide some insight to my "style, philosophies, expectations, communication preferences", and more.  

## Quotes  

Here are some of my favorite quotes, and help steer my thoughts at times.  

> "… you have to say to yourself – 'I don’t know what I’m doing. We, as a field, don’t know what we’re doing. We don’t know what programming is, we don’t know what computing is, we don’t even know what a computer is.' And once you truly understand that, once you truly believe that – then you’re free, and you can think anything."  
> - Bret Victor - The Future of Programming
