In the spirit of [this](https://hackernoon.com/12-manager-readmes-from-silicon-valleys-top-tech-companies-26588a660afe?gi=c9fee3efea74) and [this](https://soapboxhq.com/blog/management-skills/49-manager-readmes), here's a "Manager README" that has some stuff in it that might provide some insight to my "style, philosophies, expectations, communication preferences", and more.  

## Quotes  

Here are some of my favorite quotes, and help steer my thoughts at times.  

> "… you have to say to yourself – 'I don’t know what I’m doing. We, as a field, don’t know what we’re doing. We don’t know what programming is, we don’t know what computing is, we don’t even know what a computer is.' And once you truly understand that, once you truly believe that – then you’re free, and you can think anything."  
> - Bret Victor - The Future of Programming

> There are plenty of “Why?” people in the world. Whenever you hit them with an idea, they start in with their bullshit.
> “Why bother?”
> “Why try that?”
> “Why do you think you’re better than everyone else?”
> “Why?”
> To counteract this, simply surround yourself with folks who ask only “Why not?” As in …
> “Wanna make a movie?”
> “Sure. Why not?”
> Remember: It costs nothing to encourage an artist, and the potential benefits are staggering. A pat on the back to an artist now could one day result in your favorite film, or the cartoon you love to get stoned watching, or the song that saves your life. Discourage an artist, you get absolutely nothing in return, ever. I’ve spent the better part of my career getting up after movies and encouraging potential artists in the audience to give it a shot, pointing to myself as proof that anybody can make their dreams come true. I don’t do this altruistically: I’m selfishly insuring that I have cool shit to watch one day by encouraging anybody to follow passions like film or storytelling.”

> “So convenient a thing to be a reasonable creature, since it enables one to find or make a reason for every thing one has a mind to do.”
> - Benjamin Franklin
