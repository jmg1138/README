# README  

A "Manager README" for Joshua

In the spirit of [this](https://hackernoon.com/12-manager-readmes-from-silicon-valleys-top-tech-companies-26588a660afe?gi=c9fee3efea74) and [this](https://soapboxhq.com/blog/management-skills/49-manager-readmes), here's a "Manager README" that has some stuff in it that might provide some insight to my "style, philosophies, expectations, communication preferences", and more.  

## CSDD  

Customer Service Driven Development.  

I once worked as a first-party bill collector. In debt collection, you are either first-party or third-party. First-party collection is when you collects on your own debts. Third-party collection is collecting on someone else's debts. Third-party debt collectors have bad reputations for breaking the law and generally treating people horribly, maybe because they only want the money. When you are a first-party debt collector, you are not just collecting on an overdue debt, you are also interacting with your customer. Just because you are collecting on an overdue debt does not mean you forget about customer service. In fact, maintaining a high standard of customer service will probably increase your chances of collecting on the debt. The debt collector's goal is to assist the customer in repaying their debt.  

One of my managers described the job as Customer Service Based Collections. It made a big impact on me at the time, and ever since I have tried to think of everything I do as Customer Service Based.  

In the spirit of developement processes such as Test Driven Development (TDD), maybe this would be called Customer Service Driven Development (CSDD).

## Work Methodology  

I prefer a Kanban method over a Scrum method. Although both of these methods can work well together, my work usually requires more flexibility around things that I have no control over, such as changing due dates, project scope, and priorities.

## Quotes  

Here are some of my favorite quotes that help steer my thoughts at times.  

> "… you have to say to yourself – 'I don’t know what I’m doing. We, as a field, don’t know what we’re doing. We don’t know what programming is, we don’t know what computing is, we don’t even know what a computer is.' And once you truly understand that, once you truly believe that – then you’re free, and you can think anything."  
> - Bret Victor - The Future of Programming

> There are plenty of “Why?” people in the world. Whenever you hit them with an idea, they start in with their bullshit.
> “Why bother?”
> “Why try that?”
> “Why do you think you’re better than everyone else?”
> “Why?”
> To counteract this, simply surround yourself with folks who ask only “Why not?” As in …
> “Wanna make a movie?”
> “Sure. Why not?”
> Remember: It costs nothing to encourage an artist, and the potential benefits are staggering. A pat on the back to an artist now could one day result in your favorite film, or the cartoon you love to get stoned watching, or the song that saves your life. Discourage an artist, you get absolutely nothing in return, ever. I’ve spent the better part of my career getting up after movies and encouraging potential artists in the audience to give it a shot, pointing to myself as proof that anybody can make their dreams come true. I don’t do this altruistically: I’m selfishly insuring that I have cool shit to watch one day by encouraging anybody to follow passions like film or storytelling.”
